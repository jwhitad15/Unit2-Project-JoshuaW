                    known as FOTHS, is a study tool designed to facilitate Scripture memorization in saints of all ages, ethnicities, and gender.
                    Inspired by 2 Timothy 2:15, FOTHS , emphasizes the importance of learning & integrating the Fruits of the Holy Spirit into one's life.
                    FOTHS comes equipped with three unique game modes: Study (for storing the Word in the hearts of all saints), Recall (a virtual fill-in-the-blank mode that resembles flashcards),
                    and Quiz (which gives the user a choice between True/False questions and Multiple Choice).
                    flashcards, options for quiz games, options for user account &
                    interactivity with photos & more.
