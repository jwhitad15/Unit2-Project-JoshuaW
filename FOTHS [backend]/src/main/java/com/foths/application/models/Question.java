//Question model class for the FOTHS application

// This Question class represents a question in the application, with fields for question, answer, level of difficulty
// translation, fruit, and category. It uses JPA annotations for persistence and Lombok for boilerplate code reduction.
// The Question class includes constructors, getters, setters, and overrides for toString, equals, and
// hashCode methods to ensure proper behavior in collections and for debugging purposes.
