**FOTHS**, short for *Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, was created as an educational tool designed to solidify biblical teaching into the minds of its users. 
This application is for the youth, adults, clergy members, and parents alike.
FOTH's main feature comes equipped with three modes: *Study, Recall, & Quiz*. 
1. **STUDY**: a flashcard-like mode that displays Scriptures & verse titles to the user.
2. **RECALL**: a mode similar to *STUDY, RECALL* displays a Scripture with an empty text box for users to input the correct verse title.
3. **QUIZ**: a multichoice quiz that displays a single question & with four corresponding options for answers.
In addition to the main feature, Game Mode, FOTHS allows users to register a personal account, create custom goals directly in the application, and have access to additional resources that help facilitate biblical learning.
